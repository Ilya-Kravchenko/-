## Description (WHAT THE FACK IS THAT)

What is BackTrace? Well... in short: - this is a snake in an IT company. You are a bug in the system, an ordin
ary employee who received an order to 'fire' without explaining the cause and effect, but giving true and exiti
ng the work cycle is clearly not about you! Instead, you choose to fight, recovering from the bottom and crawli
ng up the BackTrac, throwing exceptions and errors along the way, to everyone who hangs around next to your str
eam of revenge ... Making your way through the legacy, valet all the tests, reach the end and prove that you ar
e not some kind of then there is a bug, and a full-fledged employee of the global IT corporation and you will n
ot be so easy to throw into the trash and forget before the cleaning period.

## Technical Stack

- Programmin Lang: Go (v 1.18)
1.18 because gopherjs is used, and it doesn't go on later versions

Go packages:
- github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs
And here he is! Needed to compile to JS

This is all! Seriously, nothing else.
